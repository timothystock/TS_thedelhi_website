== Description ==

This plugin is mainly for programmers to use. It contains an options page to set up a connection to a Google account, and allows you to choose a Google Cloud Print printer from your account and to test printing to it.

The main use of this plugin is for developers of other plugins to deploy, and integrate with their plugins. For example, it has been integrated into <a title="WooCommerce - automatically print orders, invoices and delivery notes" href="https://www.simbahosting.co.uk/s3/product/woocommerce-automatic-order-printing/">this plugin that can send orders (invoices, delivery and packing notes) from a WooCommerce web shop automatically to Google Cloud Print</a>.

To set up WordPress to have access to Google Cloud Print, you will need to follow this reasonably-simple tutorial: <a href="https://www.simbahosting.co.uk/s3/support/configuring-google-drive-api-access-for-cloud-print/">https://www.simbahosting.co.uk/s3/support/configuring-google-drive-api-access-for-cloud-print/</a>

= How can a developer use it? =

Here's some example code:

`// Ensure that we can get a Google Cloud Print Library object

if (class_exists('GoogleCloudPrintLibrary_GCPL_v2')) {

	// The first parameter to print_document() is the printer ID. Use false to send to the default. You can use the get_printers() method to get a list of those available.

	$gcpl = new GoogleCloudPrintLibrary_GCPL_v2();

	$printed = $gcpl->print_document(false, get_bloginfo('name').' - test print', '<b>My HTML to print</b>');

	// Parse the results
	if (!isset($printed->success)) {
		trigger_error('Unknown response received from GoogleCloudPrintLibrary_GCPL->print_document()', E_USER_NOTICE);
	} elseif ($printed->success !== true) {
		trigger_error('GoogleCloudPrintLibrary_GCPL->print_document(): printing failed: '.$printed->message, E_USER_NOTICE);
	}

}`

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does this plugin do? =

It is a developers' plugin. It provides code to get you connected quickly and easily to Google Cloud Print. A developer can harness it rapidly from within his own plugin to despatch print jobs to a Google Cloud Print-connected printer. For example, its underlying engine is deployed in this plugin for printing automatically WooCommerce orders (great for restaurants, take-aways or anyone who always wants to print a packing slip and wants to save time): <a href="https://www.simbahosting.co.uk/s3/product/woocommerce-automatic-order-printing/">https://www.simbahosting.co.uk/s3/product/woocommerce-automatic-order-printing/</a>

= How do I, as a developer, use it? =

Please see the plugin description.

= Please will you add a new feature? =

Only upon commission. This plugin does what I need - I am sharing it with the community, but not intending to develop it further unless I personally need to. I am happy to accept patches for improvements from the community.

= What support is provided for this plugin? =

None from me. I will accept useful patches that make this plugin more useful for others - please post them in the plugin's forum. This plugin is by a developer, for developers. To understand more of how it works beyond the description here, please read the (short, simple) code.
